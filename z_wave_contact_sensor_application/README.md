# Contact Sensor

## About
This Z-Wave 700-series based contact sensor "Reference Design" is based on a custom built hardware that is provided along with the software based on SDK 7.14.3.0 (Simplicity Studio v5) in this repository.<br>
Two hardware variations are provided:<br>
<ul>
<li> Reed Switch (SPST) option</li>
<li> Silabs Hall Sensor (Si7210-B-00-IV) option</li>
</ul>
Other hardware components:
<ul>
<li>1 temperature & humidity sensor (Si7021 OR model tbd.)</li>
<li>1 programming button (functionality for: wakeup / inclusion / exclusion / factory reset)</li>
<li>1 tampering button (detect removal of housing)</li>
<li>1 Status LED</li>
<li>1 Chip Antenna (customer version)</li>
<li>1 PCB Antenna (Silabs version)</li>
</ul>

```
#elif defined(CUSTOM_BOARD)
#include "custom_board.h"
```

## Project Setup

### Hardware Prerequisites for Debugging
<ul>
  <li>WSTK Development Board</li>
  <li>Custom board</li>
  <li>Simplicity Debug Adapter Board</li>
</ul>

### Software Prerequisites
<ul>
  <li>Simplicity Studio v5 (SSv5)</li>
  <li>Gecko SDK Suite: Z-Wave SDK 7.14.3.0</li>
</ul>

### Required Modifications
2 files that are part of the SDK need to be modified after importing the project into SSv5<br>
board.h: At line 28 & 29 add:<br>

```
#elif defined(CUSTOM_BOARD)
#include "custom_board.h"
```

board.c: At line 595: remove the "static" keyword from
```
static bool ButtonEnableEM4PinWakeup()
```
The project should now build without any errors or warnings.
